        <h3>About</h3>
        
         <p>This map is map of the fictional world of game of thrones. Game of thrones was a popular tv series that aired
            on HBO between the years of 2011 and 2019. With 38 emmy wins over its 8 season 73 episode, it is consider
            one of the best and most successful programs of all time the show is based on a series of novels by George
            RR Martin. The success of the show at HBO inspired many future spinoffs including house of the drahon which
            is currently airing on HBO, and several more shows rumored to be in production. The world of game of thrones
            spans several continents, and over 200 unique locations explored thorugh different media </p>
        
        <h4>Why?</h4>

        <p>I often find myself lost, and confused while reading new stories with large interconnected worlds. I thought
            of solving this problem by making an interactive map so I could more easily remember details about the
            world. I used html to create an interactive map that I could easily edit if necessary to add more detail and
            more information to the map as it came up in the books.
        </p>


        <h4>Frustrations?</h4>

        <p>I had big problems trying to have both implementations of the interactive maps on the same image, the
            scripts appeared to interfere with each other, and only one of them would work at any given time. I also
            grew to dislike the tabs I had implemented, at first I wanted to keep just one html file, so I had the
            content display and hide based on the tab, but this caused problems displaying some elements of the site.
        </p>

        <h4>Success</h4>

        <p>I loved learning how to manipulate images in html. I believe it has tons of useful applications that would
            be fun to build on further. I also learned usemaps for the project which helped to easily make an image
            clickable.</p>

        <h4>How I would build it differently for next time?</h4>

        <p>Next time I would combine the implementations for the zoom and the clickable portion of the map so the
            scripts would not fight for control and would work together on the same image as intended. I would also
            change the tabs to link to different html files instead of keeping them all in one file so I could more
            easily display information without problem.</p>
